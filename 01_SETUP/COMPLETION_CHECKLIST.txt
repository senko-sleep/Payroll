[ ] Verify all calculations are correct

Task 4: Document your work
[ ] Add comments to your code explaining each calculation

[ ] For each record in RESULTS, write a row to the file
[ ] Close the file
[ ] Print message saying file was saved
[ ] Handle any errors that occur

Task 3: Test your work
[ ] Run python3 payroll.py with at least 2 employees
[ ] Check results print on screen correctly
[ ] Check results.csv file exists
[ ] Open results.csv and verify all data is there
[ ] Make sure CSV is readable (can open in Excel)

Task 4: Document your work
[ ] Add comments to your code explaining what it does
[ ] Save an example results.csv file with the submission

Status: COMPLETE / IN PROGRESS / NOT STARTED

NOTES FOR TEAM
--------------

Communication:
- If you're stuck, ask your team immediately
- Don't wait - problems grow bigger
- Check your work before passing it to the next person

Testing:
- Test often, don't wait until the end
- Run the full program frequently to catch problems early

Variable names:
- MUST match between sections
- Check that next person uses same names you created
- Example: If Allen creates 'HOURSWORKED', Alexander must use 'HOURSWORKED' too

Questions to ask:
- Is my function format correct?
- Does my code use the right variable names?
- Are my calculations mathematically correct?
- Did I test error cases?
