SECURITY CHECKS IMPLEMENTED
----------------------------

All security checks are in the get_employee_data() function in payroll.py.

CHECK 1: NEGATIVE HOURS
-----------------------
What: Program rejects hours that are negative
Why: Negative hours don't make sense. An employee cannot work -5 hours.
How: if hours_worked < 0, show error message and return "invalid"
Code location: Line 61-63
Test: Enter -5 for hours worked, program rejects it

CHECK 2: HOURS EXCEED MAXIMUM
------------------------------
What: Program rejects hours over 80 (team's chosen maximum)
Why: Prevents impossible work schedules and data entry errors. 80 hours is 2 weeks of full-time work.
How: if hours_worked > MAX_HOURS_ALLOWED, show error message and return "invalid"
Code location: Line 65-67
Test: Enter 100 for hours worked, program rejects it

CHECK 3: NEGATIVE DEPENDENTS
-----------------------------
What: Program rejects dependents that are negative
Why: Cannot have negative dependents. Makes no sense.
How: if dependents < 0, show error message and return "invalid"
Code location: Line 69-71
Test: Enter -3 for dependents, program rejects it

CHECK 4: EMPTY EMPLOYEE ID
---------------------------
What: Program rejects blank employee ID
Why: Every employee must have an ID. This identifies them.
How: if EMPID == "", show error message and return "invalid"
Code location: Line 73-75
Test: Leave employee ID blank (just press enter), program rejects it

CHECK 5: OVERTIME FLAG
----------------------
What: Program shows notice if hours exceed 40
Why: Helps user verify data. If they meant to enter 40 but entered 80, this alerts them.
How: if hours_worked > 40, print "notice: overtime hours detected"
Code location: Line 77-78
Test: Enter 45 for hours worked, program shows notice message

CHECK 6: INPUT TYPE VALIDATION
-------------------------------
What: Program checks that hours and dependents are actual numbers
Why: User might type "abc" instead of 40. Program crashes without this check.
How: Use try/except to convert string input to int/float. If it fails, show error.
Code location: Line 52-60
Test: Enter "abc" for hours worked, program shows error and asks again

WHY THESE CHECKS MATTER
-----------------------
Without security checks:
- Bad data enters the system
- Calculations are wrong
- Reports are wrong
- Company pays employees incorrectly

With security checks:
- Only valid data enters the system
- Calculations are accurate
- Reports are correct
- Mistakes are caught immediately

HOW CHECKS ARE TESTED
---------------------
See test_results.txt for proof that all security checks work.

Test cases verify:
- Invalid data is rejected with error message
- Valid data is accepted
- User can retry after error
- Program continues normally after valid input
